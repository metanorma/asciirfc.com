= AsciiRFC Open Project Site

== Introduction

This is the AsciiRFC project site (a Ribose Open Project Site) located at https://www.asciirfc.com.

Built with https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll].

== Structure

The site is implemented as a https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] site.

It has a `_config.yml` for specifying the directory structure, metadata, build
defaults, etc.

And since it's also a
https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll-AsciiDoc] site, the
syntax used for writing posts is AsciiDoc, instead of the default Markdown.

=== Inputs

All source files are inside the `_jekyll/` directory, as specified in
`_config.yml`.

=== Outputs

All output files live inside the `_site/` directory, and its content have been
`gitignore`-d.


== Usage

=== Preparation

To begin developing,

[source,sh]
----
make prep
----

which would install the necessary Ruby gems for you.

=== Auto-build

To make it watch for file changes and build automatically (which watches only
the files specified in the above Inputs section), run:

[source,sh]
----
make watch
----

If you want to be sure all outputs are cleaned prior to building, run:

[source,sh]
----
make clean-watch
----

=== Just build

The non-watching equivalents for the above are simply:

[source,sh]
----
make build
----

[source,sh]
----
make clean-build
----


== Deployment

This section is only for deployment.

=== Configuration

Configure the hostname and region in the `ro-site.rc` file as you know it.

[source,sh]
----
cp ro-site.rc.template ro-site.rc
vi ro-site.rc
----

=== Uploading to S3

If you have access to the bucket, run this.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make upload
----

=== Clear CloudFront caching

The sites are accessed via CloudFront. If you're seeing
stale data after `make upload`, most likely the CloudFront
cache needs to be invalidated.

Your AWS account must be authorized to invalidate the CloudFront
cache for this distribution.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make clear-cf
----
